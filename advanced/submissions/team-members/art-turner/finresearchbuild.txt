> I am a team member on the collaborativer FinResearch project. I would like
 to accomplish the project described in 
"C:\Users\arttu\SDS-CP044-finresearch\advanced\README.md" 

● I'll help you with the FinResearch project. Let me first read the README
  file to understand what needs to be accomplished.

● Read(~\SDS-CP044-finresearch\advanced\README.md)
  ⎿  Read 257 lines

● I've read the README for the FinResearch AI Advanced Track project. This
  is a comprehensive multi-agent financial research system that you'll be
  building. Let me check what's currently in your submission directory to
  see where we should start.

● Bash(ls -la)

● Your submission directory is currently empty. This is a comprehensive
  advanced project that involves building a multi-agent financial research
  system. Let me create a plan for implementing this project:

● Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for the FinResearch AI Advanced
   Track project. This is a sophisticated multi-agent system that will
  involve:

  Core Components:
  1. Researcher Agent - Fetches news and web data
  2. Financial Analyst Agent - Computes financial ratios and metrics
  3. Manager Agent - Orchestrates the workflow
  4. Reporting Agent - Generates final reports
  5. Shared Vector Memory - ChromaDB/FAISS for context storage
  6. Gradio UI - User interface for interaction

  Key Integrations:
  - Financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, FMP, or yfinance)
  - Search APIs (Tavily or SerpAPI)
  - OpenAI for LLM capabilities

  Would you like to:
  1. Start from the beginning with project initialization (setup folders,
  requirements.txt, .env)?
  2. Jump to a specific component you'd like to focus on?
  3. Review an existing implementation approach before we start coding?

  What would you prefer?

> 1. Start from the beginning 

● Perfect! Let's start from the beginning. I'll initialize the project
  structure step by step.

     # FinResearch AI - Advanced Track
     ## Multi-Agent Financial Research System
     ### Project Overview
     This is a production-grade, multi-agent financial research system
     capable of autonomously gathering data, analyzing ratios, extracting
     insights, and generating polished investor-style reports.
     ### Architecture
     The system consists of four specialized agents:
     - **Manager Agent**: Orchestrates the entire workflow and delegates
     tasks
     - **Researcher Agent**: Fetches market news and web content
